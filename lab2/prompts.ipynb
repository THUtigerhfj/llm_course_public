       "The creation of black holes is a complex phenomenon that arises from the interplay of gravity, spacetime, and massive stellar objects. According to our current understanding of astrophysics and general relativity, black holes are formed when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic collapse, resulting in an intense concentration of mass and energy.\n",
       "\n",
       "This collapse occurs when a star with a mass greater than approximately 3-4 times that of the sun exhausts its nuclear fuel and can no longer support its own weight. At this point, the star's gravity overpowers its outward pressure, causing it to collapse in on itself. As the star's density increases, its gravity becomes so strong that not even light can escape, creating a boundary called the event horizon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Once the event horizon is formed, the star's collapse continues, resulting in a singularity at its center, where the density and curvature of spacetime are infinite. This singularity is surrounded by the event horizon, which marks the point of no return, where anything that crosses it will be trapped by the black hole's gravity.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are four types of black holes, each with different properties and formation mechanisms: stellar black holes, intermediate-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, and miniature black holes. The most well-studied are stellar black holes, which form from the collapse of individual stars, while supermassive black holes reside at the centers of galaxies and are thought to have formed through the merger of smaller black holes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Theoretical models, such as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the Kerr metric, describe the behavior of black holes and their interactions with spacetime. These models have been extensively tested through observations of X-rays, gamma rays, and gravitational waves emitted by black holes, providing strong evidence for their existence and properties.\n",

However, due to the Earth's slightly ellipsoidal shape and the fact that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, the latitude and longitude lines are not exactly parallel or equidistant. This means there will be a small discrepancy, often referred to as the \"latitude-dependent convergence\" of meridians.\n",

This means that when you moved 2000km east and then 2000km west, you would have ended up about 426km west of the original longitude (since 2426km - 2000km = 426km).\n",
